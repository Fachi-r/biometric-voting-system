# Blockchain Module

This folder contains the smart contract and local blockchain setup for the **Biometric Voting System**.  
It uses **Hardhat**, **pnpm**, and **Ethers.js** for contract deployment, interaction, and testing.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
````

Make sure you have Hardhat installed locally in your project.
If not, add it:

```bash
pnpm add -D hardhat
```

---

### 2. Run a Local Hardhat Node

Start a local blockchain with 20 pre-funded test accounts:

```bash
pnpm hardhat node
```

You’ll see a list of test accounts and their private keys printed to the terminal.

---

## 💾 Exporting Test Accounts

To make your workflow easier, we’ve added a small utility in `scripts/deploy.js` that:

* Connects to the running Hardhat node.
* Reads all available test accounts.
* Exports their **addresses** and **private keys** to a JSON file.

### Run the script:

```bash
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

This will create an `accounts.json` file in the project root with all test accounts and private keys.

---

## 🧩 Deploying Contracts

Place your contracts inside the `contracts/` directory.

Example deploy command:

```bash
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

You can modify `scripts/deploy.js` to:

* Compile contracts.
* Deploy them to the local Hardhat node.
* Log contract addresses or write them to a `deployment.json`.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* Using `pnpm` instead of `npx` **does not change** how the Hardhat node behaves.
  It simply ensures consistency with your workspace dependency tree.
* The private keys generated by Hardhat are for **local testing only** — never use them on mainnet.
* If you restart the Hardhat node, it regenerates a new set of accounts unless you persist the chain state.

### ⚠️ Pro Tip

If you want persistent test accounts between restarts,
you can copy the generated `accounts.json` and import them manually into Metamask.
